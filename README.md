# NIM-GAME
Project game NIM

The traditional game of Nim involves a random number of rows and wooden sticks for each round. In this two-player game, during their turn, a player can select any row and take any desired number of wooden sticks from that row before passing the turn to the other player. They must choose at least 1 stick and at most all the sticks in the chosen row. The key is not how many sticks one collects; rather, the crucial factor is ensuring that you are the one to pick the last stick, as that secures the victory.
